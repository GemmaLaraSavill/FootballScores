# Football Scores

An app that tracks the results of current and future football (soccer) matches using http://api.football-data.org/index API.
It shows the matches of UK's Premier League and La Liga from Spain.
Developed as part of my [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree).
Was given the starter code to debug and improve.
Now includes widgets: a simple one and a collection widget

## Instalation

Clone the code and import it as a project into [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/tools/studio/index.html)

Go to the [football-data.org/index](http://api.football-data.org/index) and request an API key. 
Once you have it add it to the strings.xml in the res/values folder
